# 🌫️ AQI Index Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains an **interactive Power BI report** for analyzing **Air Quality Index (AQI) data across India**, built using **DAX measures and calculated columns** to derive meaningful insights.

## 📊 Key Features
- **State-wise AQI distribution** using **donut chart**
- **Top 10 high AQI cities in India** using **bar chart**
- **AQI Gauge** to display **average AQI** at state and city level
- **Geographical map with bubble visualization** showing AQI across all states
- **Monthly AQI trend analysis** for each state
- **Primary pollutant identification** for deeper analysis

## 🧮 Data Modeling & DAX
- Created **DAX measures** for:
  - Average AQI
  - Max AQI
  - AQI categorization (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.)
- Used **calculated columns** to support filtering, ranking, and trend analysis

## 🎯 Objective
To identify **air pollution hotspots**, monitor **AQI trends**, and support **data-driven decisions** for environmental monitoring and public health analysis.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI  
- DAX (Measures & Calculated Columns)  
- AQI Dataset (India)
